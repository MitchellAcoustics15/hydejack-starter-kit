Many things make graduate study difficult, and each person has their own combination of hardships to deal with. At the halfway point of my PhD, I know which challenges are the hardest for me and, frankly, none of them have to do with the work or content itself. For me, these are financial stress, frustration at a lack of support and unnecessary bureaucracy, and personal isolation. I've recently noticed how much I carry the stress from these and how often they come up in just casual conversation because they are constantly at the forefront of my mind, so I've been consciously trying to limit that. But the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 outbreak has thrown all of these challenges into stark relief.

My experience of the lockdown has been like many in the UK - 9 weeks of working from home, no in-person social interactions, and a lingering fatigue from constant worrying. Unlike many, situation has left me almost entirely alone.
