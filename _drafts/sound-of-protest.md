  Our cities sound different today. They fall silent from quarantine and raise in anger from protest.

The soundscapes of our cities around the world have changed more dramatically over the last 3 months than they have in decades. In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented drastic lockdown measures, limiting movement and social gatherings. At the same time, in the 2 weeks since George Floyd's murder, protests against police brutality, directed disproportionately against Black people, have risen up in the United States and in cities around the world. The sound of these protests stands in stark contrast with the increased tranquility that cities have been experiencing since the start of the lockdown.

## The rise of the hi-fi urban soundscape
The lockdown measures have varied from complete and dramatic, to underwhelming and inadequate. These varying levels of restrictions are reflected in the changes in the city soundscapes, but across the board, noise levels have gone down. Acoustics researchers across the world are describing the changes in the sonic environment they are measuring, reporting decreases in noise levels ranging from 6 to 10 decibels, to as much as 30 dB in some cases. The lack of traffic and change in human behaviour results in a dramatic shift in the sounds we hear. Residents are reporting noticing the birds and insects more than ever before, the sound of the wind in the trees is being heard by people at their home offices for the first time. New sounds of humanity have sprung up, from the weekly clap for the NHS, to garden and street concerts and socially distanced birthday celebrations. As acousticians and urban noise experts, we are getting an unprecedented look into what our cities might sound like without the constant "overdense population of sounds" we've grown accustomed to. 

This population of sounds is described in R. Murray Schafer's seminal book "The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World", where he describes spaces which have a "Hi-Fi Soundscape". In these spaces, there is perspective, where even the slightest disturbance can communicate vital or interesting information.
