At the moment I am about two months away from the start of my PhD and there's still so much to do. In this series, I will document the process it took to get to this point, and each of hte steps as it progresses. Hopefully, since I've basically done this before, I'll be better at it this time (yeah, right).

## Try and Try Again

### T-minus (about) 3 years

This wasn't my first try at getting into a PhD program, and it also won't be my first time going through the visa process, so hopefully I'll be working from an *absolute abundance* of experience this time. When I left school with my Bachelor's degree, I didn't think there was ever a chance I'd want to go back to school. I was burnt out from exams, term papers, and grade anxiety. Then I got into the real world…and I knew I definitely didn’t want to go back to school.

I was lucky enough to be offered a job straight out of college that not only used my degree but that I really enjoyed. The pay wasn’t great, but it was a damn sight better than the minimum wage jobs I’d held in college and a boatload better than being a broke student. I had money, I had freedom, I had my own apartment; all I was missing was a dog and I would’ve been set.

Of course, the golden sheen of a new job and new-found independence can wear thin pretty quickly. I soon discovered that the provincial life in a town of less than 15,000 people (including 10,000 Uni students, with whom I definitely didn’t belong anymore) was definitely not for me. I think the final breaking point for me was going to see the new Star Wars movie and realising that 1) there was only one screen – not one cinema, just one screen – in the whole town and 2) it felt like half the town was all there at the same time. Props to those who enjoy and even prefer small-town life, but it’s definitely not for me.

### T-minus (somewhere around) 2.5 years

If you couldn’t tell from the timeline, I pretty quickly started looking for a new job, and my main criterion was that it had to be in a decent-sized city. As luck would have it, I soon received a message from a guy I had met at a recent acoustics conference I attended.

Well, I say met, what I really mean is – in the long tradition of professional conferences – I went out for an hours-long drinking session with him and some other attendees and got absolutely sloshed (and he paid! what a lad). I vaguely remember he and I discussing my current job and education and our mutual interest in me working for him, so I was pleased but not terribly surprised to receive a message from him the next week inviting me for an interview for a position in London.

To truncate a long story, he and his company impressed me and it seems I impressed him as well, as he shortly offered me a job. What a break! A great job, making at 50% more than I was at the time, in a great city! This was going to be great, and surely everything would go perfectly smoothly, with no issues. That’s how immigration works, right?

Oh how naive.
