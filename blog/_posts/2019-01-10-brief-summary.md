title: A Brief Summary of My Research (for now!)
tags:       [phd, acoustics, soundscape]
description:    I realised I've completely neglected this blog, so I thought I might as well add at least something now that I've gotten to London and started working. I promise there are good reasons for my negligence (I got robbed over New Year's Eve, for one!) and I'll hopefully be more attentive, but for now, here's a (very) short summary I wrote for a recent scholarship application. Enjoy!

## The Role of Temporal Structure in the Perception of Urban Soundscapes:
### Incorporating temporal indicators and auditory saliency as toolds for soundscape assessment

Urban noise pollution is an issue affecting 80 million EU citizens with substantial impacts on public health which are not well addressed by conventional noise control methods. Modern approaches to achieve improved health outcomes and public satisfaction incorporate a person’s perception and experience of an acoustic environment, an approach known as ‘Soundscape’. However, they lack an evaluation of the influence of temporal variation of the sonic environment on soundscape perception and struggle to generalise soundscape assessments over longer timescales. Key to this generalisation is an improved understanding of ‘auditory saliency’, or how likely a sound will be noticed and therefore have an impact on the individual’s soundscape perception. This research will combine field questionnaires and the collection of a large database of soundscapes with laboratory studies using state-of-the-art virtual reality techniques to investigate:

1. temporal acoustic characteristics influencing saliency and soundscape perception
2. variations in soundscape perception over multi-hour and multi-day timescales
3. the application of saliency for long-term soundscape assessment.

By gaining an enhanced understanding of auditory saliency and how soundscapes and their perception vary in time, consultants and planners can assess soundscape perception at larger time scales and more effectively target impactful sounds, leading to more successful and cost-effective policy.
