Welcome to my journey! I'll be honest, I'm not sure I have any business writing a blog, or whether I'll even know what to put up here, but here it goes.

Less than a week ago I found out I'd been accepted in a PhD program at University College London. Given that I've never done research before, and I live in Los Angele currently, this is going to present quite a change for me.

But thankfully, I've been through a similar process before, when I moved from Virginia to Wales for my undergraduate studies, so I have some idea of what I need to do. One of the things I remember most from that process was a wish that someone out there had written a guide for Americans moving to Wales to study (yeah, I know it's specific, but I needed to relate to it) and sadly one didn't really exist.

So this time, I decided to write a guide of my own as I go through the process and to give other people an idea of what it's like to leave the US and study, not for a semester or two, but an entire degree, in the UK.

My intention is for this blog to include the process of applying for and getting the student visa, document my travels both moving from LA to London and around Europe once I get there, and finally to follow through getting my PhD. As I get more comfortable writing, I'll probably throw in some personal stories and retrospectives to the process I went through the first time to get a BSc and how it differed. 

As part of the PhD-blog portion, I hope to essentially write up lessons and explanations of various parts of my research and readings, less for interested readers and more as a study tool for myself, but I hope anyone who reads this may find it interesting and informative anyway. 

Anyway, that's the plan but we'll all just have to tag along to see how well it goes. Wish me luck!
