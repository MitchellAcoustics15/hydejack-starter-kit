Meme text:
> This is America... We have a virus...but 99% of those who contract it will survive. We have some racists...but 99.95% of the people you meet are color blind and don't have a racial bone in their body. We have some bad cops...but 99.995% of the law enforcement personnel you encounter would risk their lives to save yours. If you choose to see evil, then evil is all you'll see. As for me...I choose to see the good in people...my heart is full...I've got nothing but love for all of you...

I constantly see memes exactly like this which try to couch their apathy and blindness in statistics. Although they seem to be neutral, they always pop up during periods of unrest, most often related to BLM, and are clearly attempting to make people think the calm, rational, loving reaction is to just be quiet. I didn't see memes with this attitude during

But this attitude and these memes are always based on lies. They cause people who don't want to think about stuff to base their opinions on lies and experience a different reality. So, I've wanted to examine the lies in one of these for a while and this one is just so obviously crap without even knowing what numbers they're trying to refer to that this is the one. I doubt anyone will ever actually look at the sources, but because I care about actually listening to the science, I'll still include them. My sources are not media articles, they are scientific articles from The Lancet, the University of Illinois, and the National Academy of Sciences.

These are either straight up wrong or meaningless. I know it's nice to think of seeing the good in people and these memes are easy to share and make you feel good. But this isn't reality.

## 1. COVID case fatality rate. 
This is the closest to being right. The reported CFR has varied widely throughout the outbreak, from 15% to 0.4%. Calculating it is difficult, and it depends on many variables, but the closest estimate comes from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was 0.99%. However, focussing on this one number ignores many of the factors which can change the CFR. It's not an inherent characteristic of a virus, it depends on the relative health of the population and their access to adequate healthcare. This is why 'flattening the curve' is important; when hospitals get overrun, their quality of care goes down and the CFR goes up. Also, minority and disadvantaged populations have been shown to have higher death rates both because they may be at more risk of contracting it and because, again, decreased quality of care increases that population's CFR. So, not entirely wrong but ignoring important facts.

## 2. Racism is "dead" in America
Hahahaha hell no. This is just such bullshit it's crazy. Where does a number of that high precision even come from for such a broad concept?! We can't adequately measure that sort of stuff to that degree, that's not how social statistics works. As far as the number itself, as of 2014, 43% of white Americans believed that racial inequality (i.e. "why blacks, on average, have worse jobs, income, and housing than whites") was because "blacks lack the necessary motivation and willpower to succeed". This was the MOST POPULAR ANSWER. In 2014, 35% of white Americans believe whites work harder than blacks and 23% BELIEVE WHITES ARE MORE INTELLIGENT. 14% of white Americans are opposed to inter-racial marriage.
If people have a problem with these numbers, they should take it up with the University of Illinois, and revise their views to match reality. The good news is, racist views have shown a consistent and meaningful decrease across the board, but this number is still absolute bullshit.

## 3. Law Enforcement "loves" you 
Again, on the face of it, this is crap. How could anyone even know a number like that?! What's the survey method that get's anywhere near answering that question, and how does it result in three significant figures? I can't even think of where to go to find this and research is literally my job. We don't even have good numbers on the rate of police encounters which result in deaths because we can't get the cops to record or publish those numbers! But hey, I'm good at my job, so here's some information on the chances for a black man of being killed by a police over their lifetime: it's 1 in 1000. 1 out of everyone 1000 black men can expect to be killed by the cops over their lifetime. This is about twice the rate of the general male population and 33 times the rate for women. "For young men of color, POLICE USE OF FORCE IS AMONG THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH."

"If you choose to see evil, then evil is all you'll see." No, if you choose to ignore reality you become complicit in evil.
