### Previously in the adventures of my adult life:

I graduated college.

I got a job in a small town.

I discovered I hated living in a small town.

I got a job in a city. Now you're all caught up. Onward!

## Applying for Visa #3

Wait, what happened to Visa numbers 1 and 2? So, my first visa was my student visa for my undergraduate studies. This is called a Tier 4 (student) visa in the UK and is relatively straightforward to get. This is actually the same sort of visa I’ll be applying for in the next few weeks, so I’ll leave the details of that process for later posts.

Visa number 2 was the work visa for my job in Wales straight out of college. This is called a Tier 2 (General) visa and is used for any normal person, from outside of the EU, who is looking to work in the UK. (I say any normal person because the UK, like most other countries, has special procedures and options open for people who can pay a lot of money – but that’s a whole other discussion for another time.)

This means this is the same type of visa I applied for for the new job in London. However, I soon discovered there are some differences between applying as a new UK graduate, and applying as a regular working stiff.

## Applying as a Working Stiff

By this point I had been through the initial conference drinks-meeting, several rounds of phone interviews and an online competence survey, traveled to London for an in-person interview (a trip where my girlfriend and I got lost somewhere south of the Thames, by the way), and gone through the salary and benefits negotiations. Needless to say I was glad to get through the process unscathed but by this point I was pretty exhausted and just ready to start working. But this was only the start of the real ordeal.

### Step 0: Resident Labour Market Test

Okay, so I’m backtracking a little bit here. The actual first step for getting a Tier 2 visa starts before a job offer can even be made. The Labour Market Test is intended to ensure that a company isn’t offering a job to a foreigner that could instead be filled by a Brit. The requirement is that an employer must widely advertise the position in several venues for a minimum of 28 days, and if any qualified Brit applies, they are required to accept them over the foreign applicant.

Note, that’s not any Brit who is more qualified, or better suited, than the foreigner, but anyone who fits the minimum requirements of the position. There are a few cases where this market test doesn’t need to be carried our, one of which is if the position is paid more than £159,600 a year. Yay for more exceptions for wealthy immigrants.

I lucked out a little in my case because the position I was being hired for technically required a Master’s degree in Acoustics – which includes a very small number of people in the UK – meaning that I didn’t have too much competition to worry about.

Still, it made for a very stressful month after my interviews in which I could have been sniped out of the job by pretty much anyone who applied, even if the guys hiring me really didn’t want to give it to someone else. Thankfully I made it through this gauntlet and the company was allowed to finally offer me the job.

### Step 1: Certificate of Sponsorship

The first step to submitting a visa application is to get a Certificate of Sponsorship from the potential employer. This is something that the employing company needs to apply for from the government for each foreign worker, and is fairly straightforward for any decently-sized company to handle. It requires that the hiring company is registered as a sponsor, which costs some amount of money, and that they have not broken any immigration laws in their hiring process in the past.

Basically, if the company can’t meet the criteria, it’s probably not a place worth working for anyway.

Between when I accepted the job offer and when the Certificate of Sponsorship was granted took about 2 weeks, so nothing too onerous so far.

### Step 2: Immigration Health Surcharge

Now we start to get into the application itself. As you might know, the UK has a socialised healthcare system known as the National Health Service, which provides comprehensive healthcare to all residents. It’s pretty great.

For British citizens it’s pretty simple and cheap to use; your payments come out of your paycheck as a tax and in my experience was not a huge amount, and there are very few if any charges at the point of service.

In the case of British citizens, the NHS is paid for through taxes, but for immigrants – even those who will be working and paying the same taxes – we are required to pay an additional Immigration Health Surcharge when submitting our application. For a work visa, this surcharge is £200 per year that the visa will be valid, so in my case it would be £600.

That’s definitely not a small amount, but in the end it’s not terrible, considering it’s equivalent to about two months’ health insurance premium in the US for a more limited plan. I’m still unsure whether I consider it ‘fair’, but I wouldn’t call it exploitative.

### Step 3: Application and Application Fee

The final step was to gather the supporting documents and pay the final application fee. In this case, everything was fairly straightforward since I was applying from inside the UK. I had to submit the proof of sponsorship, my passport and proof of all of my previous visas, and pay a £651 fee. Honestly, relinquishing my passport and residence permit while living in a foreign country was one of the most nerve-wracking things I’ve ever done even though I’d never had an issue in three years of living there.

Otherwise, the application is straightforward, with a few questions that have always raised a bit of a chuckle. For instance,  ‘Have you ever been involved in, or suspected of involvement in, war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide?’ Is that looking to catch out the one guy who’s like ‘yeah, I’m all good with genocide and crimes against humanity, but lying on a government form?! I would never! I guess I have to confess.’

My incredibly experienced and sage advice on these questions? Answer honestly, and if your honest answer is ‘yes’, then please isolate yourself from the rest of humanity.

### Step 4: That's It.

Yeah, it turns out applying for a work visa while already in the country on a work visa is pretty straightforward (or so it seems at first). The main things that made it easier for me are 1) I didn’t need to provide proof of maintenance funds ( proof that I had cash already available to live for a certain period of time) because I was already on a work visa; and 2) I didn’t need to prove evidence of my level of English, because I’m American and had a British degree by that point.

Oh, I should also say, I was extremely fortunate because the company hiring me agreed to reimburse my healthcare surcharge and application fee. It wasn’t even something we’d agreed before I accepted the job, but they were really decent people.

But, no matter how straightforward it seemed at the time, something always seems to be able to go wrong…
