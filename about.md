Andrew is a doctoral researcher in the Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering at University College London (UCL). His research interests are focussed on environmental acoustics, sound perception, and machine learning applied to subjective and perceptual data. Currently, Andrew is focussed on creating a computational model for predicting the perception of urban soundscapes and advancing our understanding of how the perception of complex sound environments is formed. 

His research is being undertaken within the European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant project dedicated to developing [Soundscape Indices (SSID)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/environmental-design/soundscape-indices-ssid). Andrew is investigating the temporal and acoustical structure of urban soundscapes through in-depth acoustical and psychoacoustical analyses with the incorporation of contextual and perceptual considerations to achieve a thorough understanding of the human experience of urban noise environments. His research will provide the acoustical framework toward the SSID projectâ€™s work to achieve a ground-breaking development in the prediction, design, and standardisation of soundscapes through the development of soundscape indices which incorporate psychological, acoustical/psychoacoustical, neural and physiological, and contextual factors of noise perception. 

Andrew is also a member of the [International Misophonia Research Network (IMRN)](https://misophonia-research.com/team/andrew-j-mitchell/) Advisory Board, lending his acoustical expertise to understanding the underlying sonic characteristic of misophonic sounds. 

In addition to his research work, Andrew continues to work as an acoustical consultant, providing guidance to other acousticians and clients about implementing soundscape in their environmental and office acoustics design practices.
